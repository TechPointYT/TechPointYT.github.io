<h2>Hello EveryBody</h2>
<blockquote>I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. No. You're too short and bossy, and your nose is all funny. Brave heart, Clara. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Come along, Pond! Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Goodbye, Clara. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know.</blockquote>
<p>Come along, Pond! Bow ties are cool. Goodbye, Clara. Brave heart, Clara. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise.</p>
<p>Don't be lasagna. It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire. That's a relief. I hate babysitters. Clara, I'm not your boyfriend. I never said it was your mistake. Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. Shut it, Hoodie! Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. You realise one of us is lying about our basic programming. And I think we both know which one that is.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the world</h2>
<blockquote>What do you think it is, a space helmet for a cow? Boring. And I hate hotels. I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. The waves of time wash us all clean. Brave heart, Clara. The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life, there's... Please just... just see me. Jo, look. That's Skaro. Goodbye, Clara. Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal.</blockquote>
<p>New-new-Doctor. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! I don't want to go. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.</p>
<p>Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... Allons-y! There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.</p>
